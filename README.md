# A Dive into Beer and Breweries.
    By Neddy Nyatome and Blake Freeman


### Purpose, Summary and scope 


Two weeks ago, Budweiser had asked Neddy and Blake Inc. to analyse a specific brewery and beer data sample and report any interesting findings that may be uncovered through the analysis. Using various data science methods, Neddy and Blake inc. have analysed data distribution, the relationship between beer and brewery and have addressed various data as needed. We used R to compile and do an EDA of the data.


## Data Sets 
    Beer.csv
    Breweries.csv 


## Getting Started


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

```
A functional PC with at least 4 GB 
```

```
Access to a command line such as gitbash
```

### Installing


```
Install R 
```
```
Clone the rep 
```
 
```
Open files in your local machine 
```


## Libraries needed in R
   ```
    tidyverse
    class 
    caret 
    e1071
    ggplot2 
```

### Break down of the code


In summary, the file (CaseStudyR.Rmd) will show that we imported data for the two files before merging them. We went ahead and addressed the nulls and duplicates before proceeding with analyzing the distribution and the relationships in the merged file. 

Note: Uset Knit in R to view the results in the html version
